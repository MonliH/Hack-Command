# Hack-Command

**Warning: this command was designed so that it can't be keyboard interupted when run in a terminal**

Just run `src.exe` or `src.py`

To make this more convincing, add `src.exe` to your PATH and rename it to `hack.exe` so when you run the `hack` command it runs it wthout you having to `cd` to the directory.

Here are some photos of the (fake) hack command.
